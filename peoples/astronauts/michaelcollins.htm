      <h1>About MICHAEL COLLINS </h1>
      <p>Michael Collins was an American astronaut who was a member of the Apollo 11 mission, the first 
manned mission to land on the Moon. Although Collins did not actually set foot on the Moon himself, he 
played a crucial role in the mission as the pilot of the Command Module, which orbited the Moon while 
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic landing. Collins also flew on the Gemini 10 mission in 
1966, where he performed a spacewalk and conducted a variety of experiments.</p>
